== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= What is different with this plugin ? =

WordPress plugin directory already filled with many of these kind of plugins.
But not all are optimized for performance.
Most of them lacks some features, while some of them cover unused features.

This plugin was developed to provide most used feature in one place without compromising the speed.
So give it a try , i am sure you will not regret for your decision.


= Tracking code not shown up in front end =

There may be several reasons for this.

* Make sure you have entered a valid tracking ID.
* Check if tracking is not disabled for current logged in user type.
* Try to flush/delete your site cache.
* Try re-installing the plugin.


= Changes does not reflect after saving settings ? =

Are you using some Cache/Performance plugin (eg: WP Super Cache/W3 Total Cache) ?

Then flush your WP cache after saving settings.

= Where does it store settings and options ? =

WP Database->wp-options->asga_options.

Uses a Single Row, stored in array for faster access.

No worry! It will remove its traces from database upon uninstall.

It will also disable tracking by removing the code from front-end.

Debugging mode allows you to troubleshot problems with Google Analytics web tracking.
